            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am pursing the Information Managment Certificate. In 2014 I received my BA in Criminal Justice. After leaving the Army in June 2023 I started working as Help Desk Tech. Now I currently work as a I.T Analyst. 
                I am taking this course to add the educational experience to my resume. With that I hope to understand and retain the knowledge.
